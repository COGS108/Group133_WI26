    "Global warming is largely caused by the accumulation of human-emitted greenhouse gases (GHG), namely, carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), which accounts for about 66% of human-emitted GHGs. <a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a><sup>1</sup> Some sources of emission include burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and manufacturing. Global datasets, such as those maintained by Our World in Data, provide long-term measurements of $CO_2$ emissions, as well as their trends across countries. They show clear differences between high- and low-income nations in per-capita emission levels. <a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a><sup>2</sup> In addition, the rise in $CO_2$ emissions result in detrimental climate change, with shifting climate patterns increasing the severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, and storms. <a name=\"cite_note-3\"></a><sup>3</sup> The differences between high- and low-income nations in per-capita emission levels, as well as the climate-disaster impacts experienced, raises questions about climate inequality.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "There has been growing research and discussion on climate inequality, which explores the ways in which climate change may disproportionately impact different groups of people. International disaster records, such as those by EM-DAT, show that disaster-related mortality rates vary over time and across regions, with certain countries experiencing significantly higher mortality rates per 100,000 people than others. <a name=\"cite_note-4\"></a><sup>4</sup> Despite contributing far less to GHG emissions, lower-income countries and vulnerable populations typically experience larger relative burdens of climate-driven losses, compared to wealthier nations and privileged populations. <a name=\"cite_note-5\"></a><sup>5</sup>\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "We can examine these climate-related disaster impacts in the form of higher mortality and economic strain. Research from global monitoring organizations highlight that economic losses are especially exacerbated in regions with weaker infrastructure and lower capacity for disaster response. <a name=\"cite_note-6\"></a><sup>6</sup> For example, climate-related harms can greatly reduce GDP growth in poorer regions and slow overall economic development, further contributing to the wider disparity in wealth and well-being between countries. <a name=\"cite_note-7\"></a><sup>7</sup> Finally, multiple analyses and systematic reviews show that inequalities in capacity and access to resources can compound the harmful effects of climate change, thus worsening the outcomes for these disadvantaged groups both within and across countries. <a name=\"cite_note-8\"></a><sup>8</sup>\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "These findings suggest that combining measures of $CO_2$ emissions and disaster impacts, in the form of higher mortality and reduced GDP per capita, can show us different countries' climate contribution versus vulnerability. By utilizing publicly available datasets on per-capita $CO_2$ emissions, mortality rates, and GDP per capita, we aim to quantify the relationship between human activity and climate outcomes across low- and high-income countries. This approach builds on prior work in climate change science and economic inequality research while applying data science and analysis practices and methods covered in this course.\n",

    "## C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "    - We recognize that country level data cannot adequately capture inequalitues or lived experiences of affected communities and groups within said country. We will discuss these limitations when interpreting results.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "    - We will examine missing data patterns and reporting differences across countries and explicitly frame results as correlational rather than causal.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "    - Visualizations and summary statistics will use approproiate scales and labels to avoid misleading representations and/or results.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "    - No PII is used or displayed at anay stage of the analysis.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "    - All data cleaning and analysis will be documented in a reproducible manner via Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "    - We ensured that the model does not rely on discriminatory proxies by using country-level variables adjusted for population size, like CO2 emissions per capita and GDP per capita. However, we recognize that these values may reflect historical inequalities, and thus interpret our results with this potential bias in mind.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "    - We will evaluate fairness by comparing model performance across low-income and high-income countries to ensure that error rates are not systematically higher for one group. This will ensure that the model performs equitably across countries oof varying economic contexts.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "    - We considered that optimizing our model for overall regression could overlook differences across income groups or population sizes. Thus, we are evaluating based on country income and using variables that account for population variation.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "    - Yes, we are breaking down groups into subgroups based on income and population size to ensure easier evaluation, reducing the chance of proxies and ultimately, confusion in correlation and causation.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate bias**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "    - We will clearly communicate dataset limitations, potential biases, and uncertainties in the final report and discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "    - We will ensure that model results are not used to unfairly judge or stigmatize any country. This research is based on factual data and intended to gain a better understanding of how economic status relates to climate vulnerability.  \n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Concept drift**: Do we test and monitor for concept drift to ensure the model remains fair over time?\n",
    "    - We monitor the model for the concept of drift by utilizing variables that account for historical inequality and differences in population size, regulating the potential of drift. \n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "    - To prevent misuse, we provide context for interpretation, limit claims to factual insights, and plan to monitor how results are communicated and applied."
