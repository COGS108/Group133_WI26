In terms of human impacts, international disaster records, such as those by EM-DAT, show that disaster-related mortality rates vary over time and across regions, with certain countries experiencing significantly higher mortality rates per 100,000 people than others. <a name=\"cite_note-4\"></a><sup>4</sup> In addition to the loss of life, these events generate economic damages, including destruction of infrastructure and housing.

For example, climate-related harms can greatly reduce GDP growth in poorer regions and slow overall economic development, further contributing to the wider disparity in wealth and well-being between countries. <a name=\"cite_note-8\"></a><sup>8</sup> These findings suggest that combining measures of emissions, disaster impacts, as well as economic indicators like GDP per capita into our analysis can show us different countries' climate contribution versus vulnerability.\n",

    "   1. Some ideal variables would be country identifier/name, year, $CO_2$ emissions per capita (e.g. metric tons per person), climate-related disaster impact (e.g. deaths and missing persons per 100,000 population), GDP per capita (e.g. USD as a proxy for national income)\n",
    "   2. Ideally, the dataset would contain several thousand observations, covering most countries worldwide over mulriple decades. This scale and time range would allow for adequate comparisons across income groups, countries, and time.\n",
    "   3. Ideally, this data would be collected by international organizations using standardized reporting methods and metrics. $CO_2$ emissions data would be compiled from national consumption statistics, disaster impact data from global disaster databases, and GDP data from national accounts collected by a standardized and regulated international organization such as the World Bank.\n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "    - This project uses publicly available, aggregated country level data collected by international organizations. No individual level data or human subjects are directly involved, so informed consent is not applicable.\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "    - Disaster related mortality may be biased due to underreporting in lower income countries with limited reporting/healthcare infrastructure. We will acknowledge this limitation and avoid over interpreting observed differences.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "    - No PII is present in the datasets, as all data are aggregated at the country level.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "    - We explicitly include GDP per capita to examine differences across income groups, which helps identify potentially unequal impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "    - The data are publicly available and non-sensitive. They will be stored locally in CSV format for analysis.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "    - We recognize that country level data cannot adequately capture inequalitues or lived experiences of affected communities and groups within said country. We will discuss these limitations when interpreting results.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "    - We will examine missing data patterns and reporting differences across countries and explicitly frame results as correlational rather than causal.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "    - Visualizations and summary statistics will use approproiate scales and labels to avoid misleading representations and/or results.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "    - No PII is used or displayed at anay stage of the analysis.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "    - All data cleaning nd analysis will be documented in a reproducible manner via Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate bias**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "    - We will clearly communicate dataset limitations, potential biases, and uncertainties in the final report and discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Concept drift**: Do we test and monitor for concept drift to ensure the model remains fair over time?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
